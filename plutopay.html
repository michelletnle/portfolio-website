                                <p>The pandemic, combined with growing technology usage, has greatly increased the
                                    popularity of ecommerce. The challenge to make
                                    purchases securely and efficiently was brought forward. Pluto Pay's goal in mind is
                                    to
                                    allow anyone to have control of their

                                <p>To understand the problem users will face, I implemented the double diamond strategy
                                    to
                                    work towards a feasible solution.
                                    By listing all the problems that users currently have, I was able to have a bird's
                                    eye
                                    view of a working hypothesis and
                                    our end goal.
                                </p>

                                <i>Inital Hypothesis: From the increase of online shopping, and less physical cash
                                    transactions, individuals need a way to bank securely and
                                    effortlessly make online financial transactions while avoiding the dangers of fraud.
                                    We
                                    will know this to be true when we see how many users send, save, and move money.</i>

                                <p>To test this hypothesis, I interviewed five compatible potential users and conducted
                                    a
                                    competitor analysis on several brands.
                                    Modeled off of results, I made two user personas, who were the forefront of my
                                    design
                                    decisions.

                                </div>

                                <p>The first design was based of off competitive and user research. Through prototyping,
                                    usability testing, and overall learning
                                    more design skills as my project developed, my design changed iteratively about
                                    seven times! One of these major design changes
                                    was to adjust my design to adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
                                    and Material Design guidelines.
                                    The most constructive critiques I received were from usability testing and peer
                                    review. In the usability testing, I interviewed six
                                    potential consumers, developed the Rainbow Spreadsheet, and changed the app
                                    cooresponding to the severity of issues.
                                </p>

                                    As Pluto Pay continues to develop and grow, consumer feedback is sure to follow; to
                                    stay on top of it, my updated hypothesis is:
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    As individuals continue to bank securely, they need to track and manage their
                                    finances, online and in-person, seamlessly wherever they go. An up-to-date Pluto Pay
                                    app and reformed Card feature will allow individuals to precisely track their
                                    shopping habits. Continuing our original goal for Pluto Pay to become an one stop
                                    financial tool, I believe the solutions we provide: budgeting, goal setting, and
                                    sending money to friends, will help the individual feel more confident.
                                    We will know this to be true when we track user retention rate and growth rate.
                                </p>

                                <p> This whole process taught me a lot about the balance of developing a design with the
                                    users' perspective and the business' needs.
                                    I've learned how important it is to learn and grow from the feedback given to you.

                                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
                                    <p>This was a fun project to tackle. As a person who uses multiple
                                        financial apps myself, I found it hard to not put my own personal
                                        opinions on how the design should look. I was quickly humbled when I interviewed
                                        others and was also reminded of why user-centric
                                        designs work best. My biggest struggle was translating my designs from pen and
                                        paper
                                        into a working prototype. With time, and lots
                                        of trial and error, I am now confident in using Figma to create thoughtful
                                        designs.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                    <h3>Main Takeaway</h3>
                                    <p>With the birth of Pluto Pay, I learned how to focus on the user and translate
                                        their
                                        thoughts into a responsive financial web app. By conducting user interviews,
                                        prototyping, and usability testing, I was able to create a functional design
                                        with
                                        Figma.
                                        If you have any questions, or would like to talk about design (Pluto Pay or
                                        otherwise), I would love to hear from you!
                                        Furthermore, please feel to test the prototype!
