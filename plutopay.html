                        <p>With the boom of the ecommerce market, the problem to make purchases securely and efficiently was brought forward.
                            How can users track all of their finances and make money transfer safely in one tool?
                        </p>

                        <h3>Solution:</h3>
                        <p>Create a responsive web app that potential users can use to transfer money, create goals and budgets, and track all of their 
                            money without the need to visit a physical bank or store.

                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>The pandemic, combined with growing technology usage, has greatly increased the popularity of ecommerce. The challenge to make 
                            purchases securely and efficiently was brought forward. Pluto Pay's goal in mind is to allow anyone to have control of their 
                            money no matter the circumstance.
                        </p>

                        <picture> <!--Double Diamond image-->
                            <source srcset="img/plutopay/all_imgs/a1e6_doublediamondstrategy_one.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">

                        </picture>

                        <p>To understand the problem users will face, I implemented the double diamond strategy to work towards a feasible solution. 
                            By listing all the problems that users currently have, I was able to have a bird's eye view of a working hypothesis and 
                            our end goal.
                        </p>

                        <p>Inital Hypothesis:</p>
                        <p> From the increase of online shopping, and less physical cash transactions, individuals need a way to bank securely and 
                            effortlessly make online financial transactions while avoiding the dangers of fraud. 
                        </p>
                        <p>We will know this to be true when we see how many users send, save, and move money.</p>

                        <p>To test this hypothesis, I interviewed five compatible potential users and conducted a competitor analysis on several brands.
                            Modeled off of results, I made two user personas, who were the forefront of my design decisions. 
                        </p>

                            <p>The first design was based of off competitive and user research. Through prototyping, usability testing, and overall learning 
                                more design skills as my project developed, my design changed iteratively about seven times! One of these major design changes 
                                was to adjust my design to adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and Material Design guidelines. 
                                The most constructive critiques I received were from usability testing and peer review. In the usability testing, I interviewed six 
                                potential consumers, developed the Rainbow Spreadsheet, and changed the app cooresponding to the severity of issues.
                            </p>

                            </picture>

                            <p> 
                                As Pluto Pay continues to develop and grow, consumer feedback is sure to follow; to stay on top of it, my updated hypothesis is: 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                As individuals continue to bank securely, they need to track and manage their finances, online and in-person, seamlessly wherever they go. An up-to-date Pluto Pay app and reformed Card feature will allow individuals to precisely track their shopping habits. Continuing our original goal for Pluto Pay to become an one stop financial tool, I believe the solutions we provide: budgeting, goal setting, and sending money to friends, will help the individual feel more confident.
                                We will know this to be true when we track user retention rate and growth rate.
                            </p>

                            <p> This whole process taught me a lot about the balance of developing a design with the users' perspective and the business' needs. 
                                I've learned how important it is to learn and grow from the feedback given to you. 
                            </p>

                            <h3>Challenges</h3>
                            <p>This was a fun project to tackle. As a person who uses multiple financial apps myself, I found it hard to not put my own personal 
                                opinions on how the design should look. I was quickly humbled when I interviewed others and was also reminded of why user-centric 
                                designs work best. My biggest struggle was translating my designs from pen and paper into a working prototype. With time, and lots 
                                of trial and error, I am now confident in using Figma to create thoughtful designs. 
                            </p>

                            <h3>Main Takeaway</h3>
                            <p>With the birth of Pluto Pay, I learned how to focus on the user and translate their thoughts into a responsive financial web app. By conducting user interviews, prototyping, and usability testing, I was able to create a functional design with Figma.
                                If you have any questions, or would like to talk about design (Pluto Pay or otherwise), I would love to hear from you!
                                Furthermore, please feel to test the prototype!
